 networks_utils: for common tasks related to network files (which are text files with two-three columns representing "source", "target" and (optionally) "sign" of interactions)
 os_utils: general python scripts for common command line tasks (e.g. easier more intuitive script for finding files)
 plotting_utils: plots related to networks; for more advanced scripts please see this repo: http://github.com/aliatiia/data.visualization
